# FigureItNow
A graghical program that plot mathematic figures from a defined script language. This is a QT-based project.

FigureItNow is my personal software project, which tries to build up a general mathematic figuring platform. It employs 
a self defined script language, and outputs mathematic figures by executing the scripts. The script language implements 
a lot of common mathematic computation, and can perform complex data manipulations. It also allows users to define 
their own functions to expand its functionality. FigureItNow also tries to support many output formats, and tries to 
provide a re-implementation interface for more potental formats. Therefore the figures produced can be used in your 
further work.

FigureItNow started in 2002, when I was a young teenage in high school. I needed a figuring tool for mathematic 
functions in studying my maths textbook. In the first several years, I released 5 main releases of FigureItNow, and 
posted them on the software downloading websites in China such as Huajun Software Park. There were tens of thousands of 
downloads since its first release. However, in recent years, I spent all of my personal time on researching work for a
degree from the university. The upgrade process of FigureItNow was stopped and the Version 6 was also aborted. 

Last year I resumed this project, and FigureItNow came to its 7th edition. I rewrote all the codes in QT development 
framework in this edition. Now, I decide to open all the source codes on github.com. Although I still have not much 
personal time on FigureItNow, I will try my best to keep the development going.
