# FigureItNow
A graghical program that plot mathematic figures from a defined script language. This is a QT-based project.

FigureItNow is a personal software project first started in 2002, when I was a young teenage in high school. I need a
figuring tool for mathematic functions in studying the maths textbook. Then a very simple software was produced in
Windows platform.
