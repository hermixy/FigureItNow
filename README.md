# FigureItNow
A graghical program that plot mathematic figures from a defined script language. This is a QT-based project.

FigureItNow is a personal software project first started in 2002, when I was a young teenage in high school. I needed a
figuring tool for mathematic functions in studying the maths textbook. Then a very simple software was produced in
Windows platform. In the next few years, I released 5 main editions of FigureItNow, and post them on the software 
downloading websites in China such as Huajun Software Park. There were tens of thousands of downloads since its first
release. 

However, in recent years, I spent all of my personal time on my researching work for a degree from the university. The
upgrade of FigureItNow is stopped. It was very pitty that the 6 edition is aborted at that time. FigureItNow has been 
never terminated in my mind. I like it, and restart this project in last year. No matter I have not much my personal 
time for this project, but I will try my best to continue this project. In addition, I decide to open the all source 
codes on github.com in late 2016. 

FigureItNow comes to its 7 edition. I will keep maintaining the project FigureItNow, and make it better.
